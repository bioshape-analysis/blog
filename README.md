# MATH 612 Shape Analysis Blog Repository

Welcome to the **MATH 612 Shape Analysis Blog Repository**, a collection of educational content for students of MATH 612 at UBC. This repository is designed to help students explore and contribute to the ongoing analysis and discussion of shape analysis using various computational tools. The content is primarily built using **Quarto** and integrates **Jupyter notebooks**, making it a hands-on, interactive learning platform.

## Purpose

This repository serves as the foundation for blog posts related to MATH 612, where students can share tutorials, analyses, and insights on topics such as bioshape analysis. Each post is an opportunity to learn and contribute to the broader field of mathematical biology. The goal is to encourage collaboration and foster learning in computational and analytical techniques in shape analysis.

For the blog itself, visit [the blog page here](https://bioshape-analysis.github.io/blog/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need the following tools:

- **Git**: Install from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Python 3.x**: Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application for interactive data science and scientific computing.
- **Quarto**: A publishing system to create dynamic documents and blogs.

### Cloning the Repository

To contribute or explore the content:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bioshape-analysis/blog
cd blog
```

### Blog Post Guidelines

Blog posts should be written in **Quarto** and stored in the `posts/` directory. Use a consistent naming convention and ensure that the **YAML** header is correctly formatted. For more details, refer to the [introductory blog post](https://bioshape-analysis.github.io/blog/posts/MATH-612/).
