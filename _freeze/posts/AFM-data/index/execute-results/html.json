We want to study the bacteria cell shape and extract the main geometrical feature.\n\n## Biological context\n*Mycobacterium smegmatis* is Grahm-positive rod shape bacterium. It is 3 to 5 $\\mu m$ long and around 500 $nm$ wide. This non-pathogenic species is otften used a biological model to study the pathogenic Mycobacteria such as *M.tuberculosis* (responsible for the tubercuosis) or *M.abscessus*, with which it shares the same cell wall structure[@tyagi2002mycobacterium] . In particular *M.smegmatis* has a fast growth (3-4 hours doubling time compared to 24h for *M. tuberculosis*), allowing for faster experimental protocols. \n\n\nHere are some know properties of *M.smegmatis* bacteria :\n\n* They present variation of cell diameter along their longitudinal axis [@eskandarian2017division]. The cell diameter is represented as a height profile along the cell centerline. We respectively name peaks and troughs the local maxima and minima of this proile.\n\n![3D image of *M.smegmatis*. The orange line represents the height profile.](3D_cell.png)\n\n* They grow following a biphasic and asymetrical polar dynamics[@hannebelle2020biphasic]. The cells elongate from the poles, where material is added. After division, the pre-existing pole (OP) elongate at a high rate, whereas the newly created pole (NP) has first a slow growth, and then switches to a fast growth, after the New End Take Off (NETO).\n\n![Growth dynamics.](Neto.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Raw image pre-processing\n#### Data\n\nSeveral data acquisitions were conducted with wild types and different mutant strains. The raw data is composed of AFM log files times series for each experiments. Each log file contain several images, each one representing a physical channel such as height, stiffness, adhesion etc.\n\n## Segmentation\n\n\n## Centerline\n\n",
