Great for running small code snippets and visualizing data. Learn more in the [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n- **VS Code:** A powerful IDE for writing and debugging code. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and install relevant extensions for [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [LaTeX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop).\n- **Environments:** Use virtual environments like [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to manage dependencies and ensure consistent results across different setups.\n- **Quarto:** Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for creating high-quality documents, reports, and presentations from your code. It supports markdown and integrates seamlessly with Jupyter and VS Code for reproducible analysis and publication. Check out the [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) for more information. To get started quickly, you can refer to this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/riddhibattu/introduction-to-quarto).\n\n## Using GitHub\n- **Create a GitHub Account:** Sign up at [GitHub.com](https://github.com).\n- **Repositories:** Start by creating a repository to host your project files. Learn how in [GitHub's guide to repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo). Use a [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file to exclude unnecessary files.\n- **Branches:** Work on separate branches (`main`, `dev`, feature branches) to manage different versions of your project. More details in [GitHub's guide on branching](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).\n- **Merges:** Merge changes into the `main` branch only after thorough review and testing. Learn about [merging branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).\n- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages to document changes effectively. Follow the [best practices for commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).\n\n## Using Quarto to create blog posts\n\nQuarto document layout:\n![](../img/quarto_doc_format.png){ width=65% style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" }\n\n1. **Log into GitHub:** Make sure you have an account and are logged in.\n2. **Send your account username/email to[kdd@math.ubc.ca](kdd@math.ubc.ca):** This is needed to be added to the organization.\n3. **Clone the repository:** After being added to the organization, clone the repository: `https://github.com/bioshape-analysis/blog`.\n   ```sh\n   git clone https://github.com/bioshape-analysis/blog`\n   ```\n4. **Create a new branch:** To contribute to the blog, create a new branch using:\n   ```sh\n   git checkout -b <branch_name>\n   ```\n   - Verify your branch and repository location: Use the following command to check if you are in the correct branch and repository:\n     ```sh\n     git status\n     ```\n     This command will show you the current branch you are on and the status of your working directory, ensuring you are working in the right place\n\n5. **Navigate to `posts`:** Go into the `posts` directory ([found here](https://github.com/bioshape-analysis/blog/tree/main/posts)). Create a new folder with a name that represents the content of your blog post.\n6. **Create or upload your content:**\n   - If using Jupyter Notebooks, upload your `.ipynb` file.\n   - If preferred, create a new notebook for your post. Once done, convert it into Quarto using the command:\n     ```sh\n     quarto convert your_jupyter_notebook.ipynb -o output_file.qmd\n     ```\n7. **Edit the YAML in your `.qmd` file:** Ensure your YAML is consistent with the main template. For example:\n   ```yaml\n   ---\n   title: \"Title of your blog post\"\n   date: \"Date\" # Format example: August 9 2024\n   author:\n     - name: \"Your Name\" \n   categories: [] # [biology, bioinformatics, theory, etc.]\n   bibliography: references.bib # If referencing anything\n   ---\n   ```\n   Feel free to add further formatting, but ensure it remains consistent with the main template.\n8. **Delete your Jupyter notebook:** After converting it to a `.qmd` file, delete the original `.ipynb` file to prevent duplication in the blog post.\n9. **Commit and push your changes:** After completing your `.qmd` file, push your branch to GitHub. A pull request will be automatically created, and once reviewed, it will be merged into the main branch.\n\n### Additional Information for Quarto:\n\n- **Add Images:**\n  You can add images to your Quarto document using markdown syntax:\n  ```markdown\n  ![Image Description](path/to/image.png)\n  ```\n  To add images from a URL:\n  ```markdown\n  ![Image Description](https://example.com/image.png)\n  ```\n- **Add References:**\n  Manage references by creating a `bibliography.bib` file with your references in BibTeX format. Link the bibliography file in your Quarto document header (YAML).\n  Cite references in your text using the following syntax:\n  ```markdown\n  This is a citation [@citation_key].\n  ```\n- **Other Edits:**\n  Add headers, footnotes, and other markdown features as needed. Customize the layout by editing the YAML header.\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Format of a Quarto Doc\"\ndate: \"August 4 2024\"\nauthor:\n    - name: \"Khanh Dao Duc\" \ncategories: [MATH 612]\n---\n\n\n# Welcome to Math 612\n\n# Running Code\nWhen you click the **Preview** or **cmd+shif+k** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
