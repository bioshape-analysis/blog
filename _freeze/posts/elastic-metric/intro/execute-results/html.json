[@mio2007shape], can be defined over the space $\\mathcal{C}$ of smooth parametrized curves $c:[0,1]\\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^2$ with nowhere-vanishing derivative. With $a,b>0$ denoting the parameters of the family, one associates with every curve $c \\in \\mathcal{C}$ an inner product $g^{a, b}_c$ over the tangent space $T_c{\\mathcal{C}}$, given by @bauer2014constructing; @needham2020simplifying,\n\n$$g^{a, b}_c(h, k) = a^2\\int_{[0,1]}\\langle D_sh, N\\rangle\\langle D_sk, N\\rangle ds + b^2 \\int_{[0,1]}\\langle D_sh, T\\rangle\\langle D_sk, T\\rangle ds,$${#eq-elastic}\n\nwhere $h,k$ are two curve deformations in  the tangent space $T_c{\\mathcal{C}}$, that can also be considered as planar curves [@mio2007shape]; $<,>$ is the Euclidean inner-product in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, $D_s = \\frac{1}{||c'(s)||}\\frac{d}{ds}$, is a differential operator with respect to the arc length $s$, and $N$ and $T$ respectively are the local unit normal and tangent from a moving frame associated with $c$.  \n Intuitively, elements in $T_c{\\mathcal{C}}$ represent infinitesimal deformations of $c$, and $g^{a, b}_c$ quantifies the magnitude of these deformations, with the two factors $a$ and $b$ that can be interpreted as weights penalizing the cost of bending (for $a$) and stretching (for $b$) the curve $c$.\n\nIn [@fig-elastic-metric].A, we illustrate how the metric can be interpreted for a local deformation $h$ of $c$: As we project the derivative of $h$ (with respect to its arc length) along the tangent and normal vectors of the reference frame associated with $c$, increasing the bending in $h$ results in a relatively higher contribution from the normal component, and thus the integral weighted by $a^2$, according to [@eq-elastic]. Similarly, stretching increases the contribution from the tangent component, and the integral weighted by $b^2$. In the case that $(a,b)=(1,1/2)$, the elastic metric is called Square Root Velocity metric, as it allows in practice for an efficient evaluation [@srivastava2010shape; @le2019discrete].\n\n![Elastic metric on cell shapes. \\textbf{A:} We illustrate how the elastic metric applies to a given shape $c$ (shown in left) and a local deformation $h$. According to [@eq-elastic], this metric is given by the sum of two components, which integrate the projection of the derivative of $h$ with respect to the arc length ($\\mathbf{D_s h} \\ ds$), on $\\mathbf{N}$ and $\\mathbf{T}$ respectively, which are the local normal and tangent vectors of $c$ (shown in right). The projection on $\\mathbf{N}$ ($\\mathbf{T}$) emphasizes bending (stretching) deformations, as shown in top (bottom) right. \\textbf{B:} Upon implementing the metric in Geomstats, we can construct a geodesic path between two cell shapes, as a continuous deformation (with intermediate cells in grey) that minimizes the path length (see [@eq-distance]) and yields a geodesic distance (see Material and Methods).](figs/elastic_metric.pdf){#fig-elastic-metric}\n\n\n### Geodesic distance\nAs a Riemaniann metric [@mio2007shape; @srivastava2010shape], the elastic metric yields a geodesic distance over $\\mathcal{C}$: For two curves $c_0$ and $c_1$ and a regular parameterized path $\\alpha:[0,1] \\mapsto \\mathcal{C}$ such that $\\alpha(0)=c_0$ and $\\alpha(1)=c_1$, the length of $\\alpha$, associated with the elastic metric $g^{a,b}$ is given by\n$$\nL^{a,b}[\\alpha] = \\int_0^1 g^{a,b}_{\\alpha(t)} (\\alpha'(t),\\alpha'(t))^{1/2}dt,\n$${#eq-length}\nand the \\emph{geodesic} \\emph{distance} between $c_0$ and $c_1$ is\n$$\nd^{a,b}(c_0,c_1) = \\inf_{\\alpha:[0,1] \\mapsto \\mathcal{C} \\ | \\ \\alpha(0)=c_0 \\ ; \\ \\alpha(1)=c_1} L^{a,b}[\\alpha]. \n$${#eq-distance}\n[@fig-elastic-metric].B illustrates the shortest path joining two cell shapes using the elastic metric.\n\nAn approximation of the geodesic distance associated with the elastic metric $g^{a,b}$ can be computed as a pull-back of the linear metric: Upon applying a transformation that maps the geodesic associated with $g^{a, b}$ into a straight line, the geodesic distance is equal to the $\\mathcal{L}^2$ distance between the two transformed curves [@needham2020simplifying]. \nWhile the procedure to construct the mapping can be numerically unstable \\cite{bauer2014constructing,needham2020simplifying}, it is simple for the SRV, with the geodesic distance being the $\\mathcal{L}^2$ distance obtained upon representing the curve by its speed, renormalized by the square root of its norm as\n$q(c) = \\dot{c}/\\sqrt{\\lvert \\dot{c} \\rvert}$ [@bauer2022elastic].\n\n### Fréchet mean\nWith the space of curves equipped with this distance, the so-called Fréchet mean of $n$ curves $(c_1,\\ldots,c_n)$ \\cite{miolane2020introduction} is defined as\n$$\n\\bar{c} =  \\underset{c \\in \\mathcal{C}}{\\text{argmin}} \\sum_{i=1}^n (d^{a,b}(c,c_i))^2. \n$${#eq-mean}\n\n\n## References\n\n",
