We present here the protocole to process biological images such as bacteria atomic force miroscopy data. We want to study the bacteria cell shape and extract the main geometrical feature.

## Biological context
*Mycobacterium smegmatis* is Grahm-positive rod shape bacterium. It is 3 to 5 $\mu m$ long and around 500 $nm$ wide. This non-pathogenic species is otften used a biological model to study the pathogenic Mycobacteria such as *M.tuberculosis* (responsible for the tubercuosis) or *M.abscessus*, with which it shares the same cell wall structure[@tyagi2002mycobacterium] . In particular *M.smegmatis* has a fast growth (3-4 hours doubling time compared to 24h for *M. tuberculosis*), allowing for faster experimental protocols. 


Here are some know properties of *M.smegmatis* bacteria :

* They present variation of cell diameter along their longitudinal axis [@eskandarian2017division]. The cell diameter is represented as a height profile along the cell centerline. We respectively name peaks and troughs the local maxima and minima of this proile.

* They grow following a biphasic and asymetrical polar dynamics[@hannebelle2020biphasic]. The cells elongate from the poles, where material is added. After division, the pre-existing pole (OP) elongate at a high rate, whereas the newly created pole (NP) has first a slow growth, and then switches to a fast growth, after the New End Take Off (NETO).
