              Motivation
              The shape of a cell is tightly controlled, and reflects important processes including actomyosin activity, adhesion properties, cell differentiation, and polarization. Hence, it is informative to link cell shape to genetic and other perturbations. However, most currently used cell shape descriptors capture only simple geometric features such as volume and sphericity. We propose FlowShape, a new framework to study cell shapes in a complete and generic way.
            
            
              Results
              In our framework a cell shape is represented by measuring the curvature of the shape and mapping it onto a sphere in a conformal manner. This single function on the sphere is next approximated by a series expansion: the spherical harmonics decomposition. The decomposition facilitates many analyses, including shape alignment and statistical cell shape comparison. The new tool is applied to perform a complete, generic analysis of cell shapes, using the early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo as a model case. We distinguish and characterize the cells at the seven-cell stage. Next, a filter is designed to identify protrusions on the cell shape to highlight lamellipodia in cells. Further, the framework is used to identify any shape changes following a gene knockdown of the Wnt pathway. Cells are first optimally aligned using the fast Fourier transform, followed by calculating an average shape. Shape differences between conditions are next quantified and compared to an empirical distribution. Finally, we put forward a highly performant implementation of the core algorithm, as well as routines to characterize, align and compare cell shapes, through the open-source software package FlowShape.

              Motivation
              Uncovering the cellular and mechanical processes that drive embryo formation requires an accurate read out of cell geometries over time. However, automated extraction of 3D cell shapes from time-lapse microscopy remains challenging, especially when only membranes are labeled.
            
            
              Results
              We present an image analysis framework for automated tracking and three-dimensional cell segmentation in confocal time lapses. A sphere clustering approach allows for local thresholding and application of logical rules to facilitate tracking and unseeded segmentation of variable cell shapes. Next, the segmentation is refined by a discrete element method simulation where cell shapes are constrained by a biomechanical cell shape model. We apply the framework on Caenorhabditis elegans embryos in various stages of early development and analyze the geometry of the 7- and 8-cell stage embryo, looking at volume, contact area and shape over time.

              marching cubes
              , that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of
              marching cubes
              . We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},
