## Instructions
- Follow all guidelines for assignments and projects.
- Submit your work through the designated platforms by the due dates.
- Collaborate with peers but ensure individual work is original.

## Tips
- **Jupyter:** Use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for interactive coding and documentation. Great for running small code snippets and visualizing data. Learn more in the [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- **VS Code:** A powerful IDE for writing and debugging code. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and install relevant extensions for [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [LaTeX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop).
- **Environments:** Use virtual environments like [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to manage dependencies and ensure consistent results across different setups.
- **Quarto:** Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for creating high-quality documents, reports, and presentations from your code. It supports markdown and integrates seamlessly with Jupyter and VS Code for reproducible analysis and publication. Check out the [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) for more information. To get started quickly, you can refer to this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/riddhibattu/introduction-to-quarto).

## Using GitHub
- **Create a GitHub Account:** Sign up at [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
- **Repositories:** Start by creating a repository to host your project files. Learn how in [GitHub's guide to repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo). Use a [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file to exclude unnecessary files.
- **Branches:** Work on separate branches (`main`, `dev`, feature branches) to manage different versions of your project. More details in [GitHub's guide on branching](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
- **Merges:** Merge changes into the `main` branch only after thorough review and testing. Learn about [merging branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages to document changes effectively. Follow the [best practices for commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

## Using Quarto to create blog posts
1. **Log into GitHub:** Make sure you have an account and are logged in.
2. **Send your account username/email to [kdd@math.ubc.ca](mailto:kdd@math.ubc.ca):** This is needed to be added to the organization.
3. **Clone the repository:** After being added to the organization, clone the repository: `https://github.com/bioshape-analysis/blog`.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bioshape-analysis/blog`
   ```
4. **Create a new branch:** To contribute to the blog, create a new branch using:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b <branch_name>
   ```
   - Verify your branch and repository location: Use the following command to check if you are in the correct branch and repository:
     ```sh
     git status
     ```
     This command will show you the current branch you are on and the status of your working directory, ensuring you are working in the right place

5. **Navigate to `posts`:** Go into the `posts` directory ([found here](https://github.com/bioshape-analysis/blog/tree/main/posts)). Create a new folder with a name that represents the content of your blog post.
6. **Create or upload your content:**
   - If using Jupyter Notebooks, upload your `.ipynb` file.
   - If preferred, create a new notebook for your post. Once done, convert it into Quarto using the command:
     ```sh
     quarto convert your_jupyter_notebook.ipynb -o output_file.qmd
     ```
7. **Edit the YAML in your `.qmd` file:** Ensure your YAML is consistent with the main template. For example:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Title of your blog post"
   date: "Date" # Format example: August 9 2024
   author:
     - name: "Your Name" 
   categories: [] # [biology, bioinformatics, theory, etc.]
   bibliography: references.bib # If referencing anything
   ---
   ```
   Feel free to add further formatting, but ensure it remains consistent with the main template.
8. **Delete your Jupyter notebook:** After converting it to a `.qmd` file, delete the original `.ipynb` file to prevent duplication in the blog post.
9. **Commit and push your changes:** After completing your `.qmd` file, push your branch to GitHub. A pull request will be automatically created, and once reviewed, it will be merged into the main branch.

### Additional Information for Quarto:

- **Add Images:**
  You can add images to your Quarto document using markdown syntax:
  ```markdown
  ![Image Description](path/to/image.png)
  ```
  To add images from a URL:
  ```markdown
  ![Image Description](https://example.com/image.png)
  ```
- **Add References:**
  Manage references by creating a `bibliography.bib` file with your references in BibTeX format. Link the bibliography file in your Quarto document header (YAML).
  Cite references in your text using the following syntax:
  ```markdown
  This is a citation [@citation_key].
  ```
- **Other Edits:**
  Add headers, footnotes, and other markdown features as needed. Customize the layout by editing the YAML header.
