## Background
Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a cryomicroscopy technique applied on samples embedding in ice, along with recent development of more powerful hardwares and softwares, have achieved huge success in the determination of biomolecular structures at near-atomic level. Cryo-EM takes screenshots of thousands or millions of particles in different poses frozen in the sample, and thus allows the reconstruction of the 3D structure from those 2D projections. 

Early algorithms and softwares of processing cryo-EM data focus on resolving homogeneous structure of biomolecules. However, many biomolecules are very dynamic in conformations, compositions, or both. For example, ribosomes comprises of many sub-units, and their compositions may vary within the sample and are of research interest. Spike proteins
