## Introduction

The ribosome is present in all domains of life, although it exhibits varying conservation across phylogeny. It has been found that, as translation proceeds, the nascent polypeptide chain interacts with the tunnel, and, as such, the geometry of the tunnel plays a role in translation dynamics and resulting protein structures [@dao2019differences]. With advances in imaging of ribosome structure with cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), there is ample data on which geometric analysis of the tunnel may be applied, and therefore there is a need for more computational tools to do so [@dao2020heterogeneities].

In order to preform geometric shape analysis on the ribosome, we must first superimpose mathematical definitions onto this biological context. Among others, one way of defining shape mathematically is with a set of landmarks. A landmark is a labeled point on some structure, which, biologically speaking, has some meaning. After removing the effects of translation, scaling, and rotation, sets of landmarks form a shape space, on which statistical analysis may be applied. 

Assigning landmarks to biological shapes is not a new idea; many examples involve defining landmarks as joins between bones or muscles, or as points along observed curves [@dryden]. However, there has been little work in assigning landmarks to biological molecules, and none specifically to the ribosome exit tunnel. The challenge is that any one landmark must have comparable instances across shapes in the shape space, meaning that we cannot arbitrarily pick residues which we know to be near to the tunnel. Such residues must be conserved, and therefore present in each specimen, to be considered useful. With this in mind, I present a Python protocol for assigning landmarks to the surface of the ribosome exit tunnel.

## Protocol Overview

Landmarks assigned on the surface of the tunnel are defined as the mean atomic coordinates of conserved residues that are close to the tunnel surface. The general steps in the protocol are:

1. Run Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) on the relevant polymers and select residues that are above a conservation threshold.
2. Of the conserved residues, select only the residues that are within a distance threshold of the tunnel as represented by the Mole model [@mole].
3. Extract the 3D coordinates of the selected residues.

The full protocol is available [here](https://github.com/eteasell/ribosome-exit-tunnel-v2).

## Implementation Details

### Separation by Kingdom

The protocol has two main entry points: `main.py` and `main_universal.py`. The `main` file assigns intra-kingdom landmarks; conserved residues are chosen only based on sequences from the given kingdom, meaning that the landmarks are specific to one of the three biological super-kingdoms (eukaryota, bacteria, and archaea). Using `main`, landmarks for one kingdom do not directly correspond to landmarks for another kingdom. While this separation prevents inter-kingdom comparison directly, it allows for a higher number of landmarks to be assigned to each specimen, due to higher degrees of conservation within kingdoms. The alternative is to use `main_universal`, which chooses conserved residues based on all sequences. This provides less landmarks per ribosome, but allows for inter-kingdom comparison, as each landmark will have correspondence across all specimens.

### Data

The protocol uses data from RibosomeXYZ [@riboxyz] and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) via API access. For each ribosome structure, the protocol requests sequences and metadata (chain names, taxonomic information, etc.) from RibosomeXYZ for selected proteins and RNA and the full `mmcif` structural file from the PDB. This data is stored locally to facilitate repeated access during runtime.

### Alignments

The program uses MAFFT [@mafft] to preform Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) on all of the available sequences for each of the relevant polymers. It accesses sequence data from RibosomeXYZ polymer files. When the program is run on new specimens, if the sequences are not already in the input `fasta` files, they are automatically added and the alignments are re-run to include the new specimens.

### Selecting Landmarks

Landmarks are selected using a prototype ribosome and based on conservation and distance. The program searches for landmarks only on polymers which are known to be close to the tunnel [@dao2019differences].

| Kingdom | Prototype | Selected Polymers |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Eukaryota      | 4UG0               | uL4, uL22, eL39, 25/28S rRNA |
| Bacteria       | 3J7Z               | uL4, uL22, uL23, 23S rRNA    |
| Archaea        | 4V6U               | uL4, uL22, eL39, 23S rRNA    |
| Universal      | 3J7Z               | uL4, uL22, 23/25/28S rRNA    |

#### Conservation

To be chosen as a landmark, residues must be at least 90% conserved. This threshold is a tuneable parameter. For each of the relevant polymers, the program iterates through each position in the MSA alignment file for that polymer and selects alignment positions for which at least 90% of specimens share the same residue. This excludes positions where gaps are the most common element. The program calls the below method on every column of the MSA for each of the relevant polymers to obtain a short-list of alignment positions to be considered for landmarks.

```{python}
def find_conserved(column, threshold):
    counter = Counter(column)
    mode = counter.most_common(1)[0]
    
    if (mode[0] != '-' and mode[1] / len(column) >= threshold):
        return mode[0]
    
    return None
```


#### Distances

For each candidate conserved position, the program first locates the residue's coordinates on the prototype specimen (see @sec-locating-landmarks for more detail). For each prototype, I have run the Mole tunnel search algorithm \cite{mole} to extract the centerline coordinates of the tunnel and the radius at each point. Then for each candidate landmark $p_l$, I find the nearest centerline point $p_c$ by euclidean distance, and compute the distance from $p_l$ to the sphere centered at $p_c$ with the given radius $r_c$:
$$ d = ||p_l - p_c|| - r_c$$
If $d$ is less than the distance threshold, the candidate position is considered a landmark. See the code below for reference:

```{python}
def find_closest_point(p, instance):
    coords = get_tunnel_coordinates(instance)
    dist = np.inf
    r = 0
    p = np.array(p)
    
    for coord in coords.values():
        xyz = np.array(coord[0:3])
        euc_dist = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(xyz - p))) - coord[3]
        if euc_dist < dist:
            dist = euc_dist
    
    return dist
```

Each selected landmark's residue type and alignment location are saved to file, so that new ribosome specimens can use the list as a guideline.

### Locating landmarks {#sec-locating-landmarks}

Locating the chosen landmarks in the structural file for a given ribosome specimen is the most involved step of the protocol. Often, a ribosome `mmcif` file contains some gaps, due to experimental/imaging conditions. For this reason, I take an approach using methods from RibosomeXYZ's backend [@riboxyz] to keep track of residue locations as sequences are manipulated (aligned, flattened to remove gaps, etc.). We have access to two copies of the sequence for each polymer: the sequence from the RibosomeXYZ polymer data, which is well formed, and the `mmcif` PDB sequence that is tied to the 3D structure, which often has gaps. The protocol makes use of both versions.

The PDB sequence is loaded into memory as an object using BioPython. This object holds all of the structural and hierarchical information present in the original file. This is more useful than working with sequences as strings. For example, indexing a protein sequence gives a unique residue object which holds structural information, rather than just a symbolic letter.

I use the `SeqenceMappingContainer` class taken from RibosomeXYZ. The purpose of this class is to facilitate working with the PDB structural sequences with gaps. Initializing the class with a polymer sequence as a BioPython Chain object gives a 'primary' unchanged version of the sequence and a 'flattened' version with all gaps removed, as well as mappings for indices between the two. Given an index in the flattened sequence, we can use the maps to find the index in the primary sequence and therefore the author assigned residue IDs and structural information, and vice versa. This is the backbone of locating residues by sequence numbers from the landmark list on potential gappy polymer sequences.

The algorithm for locating a landmark is as follows:

1. Access the aligned sequence from the MSA, and map the landmark from the location in the alignment to the location in the original RibsomeXYZ sequence for this polymer instance.
2. Perform a pairwise sequence alignment on the original RibosomeXYZ sequence and the flattened PDB sequence.
3. Use this pairwise alignment to map the landmark location in the original RibosomeXYZ sequence to the location in the flattened PDB sequence.
4. From the flattened PDB sequence, use `SeqenceMappingContainer` mapping to find the residue ID in the primary PDB sequence, and use this ID to index the Residue object.
5. Ensure that the residue type matches the landmark type (i.e. amino acids / nucleotides match), and return the mean coordinates of the atoms in the residue as the landmark coordinates.

## Usage Instructions

The full protocol and datasets are avaiblable on [GitHub](https://github.com/eteasell/ribosome-exit-tunnel-v2/blob/main/protocol/locate_residues.py). At the time of writing, the protocol has been run on all 1348 ribosomes currently available on RibosomeXYZ. Landmark coordinates (kingdom-specific and universal) can be found in `data/output/landmarks`.

To assign these initial landmarks, I compiled the sequences for the relevant polymers for all 1348 specimens into polymer-specific `fasta` files and ran MAFFT sequence alignment on each file. Then, I ran the code to select landmarks based on the full aligned files; therefore, conservation ratios for residues were based on all (currently) available data.

| Kingdom | Number of Specimens | Landmarks per specimen|
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Eukaryota      | 424              | 83 |
| Bacteria       | 842               | 60    |
| Archaea        | 82               | 47    |
| Universal      | 1348              | 42    |

*Distribution of assigned landmarks across currently available ribosomes*

To obtain landmarks on a ribosome specimen, first check if they have already been assigned. If not, the protocol can be run on new specimens as follows:

1. Use `main_universal.py` to assign universal landmarks or `main.py` to assign kingdom-specific landmarks
2. Create a `conda` environment based on `requirements.txt` and activate it
3. With the activated environment, run the following command:
    `python -m protocol file rcsb_id` where `file` is one of `main_universal.py` or `main.py`, and `rcsb_id` is the structure ID.
    - The protocol can be run on multiple instances simply by adding more `rcsb_id`'s to the command. For example: `python -m protocol file rcsb_id1 rcsb_id2`
    - Note that running multiple instances in the same command is more efficient when these are new instances, as the alignment will run only once after all new sequences have been added to the `fasta` files, rather than after each new instance.

As mentioned above, the program will automatically update the `fasta` files and rerun the alignments to include new instances from the command. This should not change the conserved residues when small amounts of new ribosomes are added, but if you are adding many new ribosomes, you may consider changing the `reselect_landmarks` boolean flag to `True`, to ensure that the assigned landmarks reflect the conservation present in the entirety of the data. This flag can also used to apply changes to conservation and distance threshold parameters. It is important to note, however, that re-selecting landmarks disrupts the correspondence of newly assigned landmarks to previously assigned landmarks. 


## Limitations

1. When choosing landmarks, the thresholding by distance is done by comparison to the Mole tunnel model. However, this model is too simplistic to capture the complex shape of the tunnel. A more accurate model is the mesh model as described in ['3D Tessellation of Biomolecular Cavities'](https://bioshape-analysis.github.io/blog/posts/ribosome-tunnel-new/). There are gaps in the landmarks where the mesh model shows protrusions that the Mole model does not capture. Future improvements to the protocol should be made to measure distance to the tunnel using the mesh representation as a benchmark instead of the centerline and radii.
2. The protocol automatically runs MAFFT sequence alignment from the command line when the input `fasta` files are updated. However, running MAFFT online can be much faster. To maximize efficiency when running the protocol on many ribosomes, I suggest running the input `fasta` files through MAFFT online, and uploading the resulting alignments into the protocol directory (ensuring to match the location and naming of the original files).
3. There remains missing landmarks on many ribosome specimens in the data, due to gaps in the experimental data or unusual specimens (e.g. imaged mid biogenesis). Filtering out these instances would be beneficial prior to analysis.
