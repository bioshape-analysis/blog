abstract="We examine how a specific instance of the elastic metric, the Square Root Velocity (SRV) metric, can be used to study and compare cellular morphologies from the contours they form on planar surfaces. We process a dataset of images from osteocarcoma (bone cancer) cells that includes different treatments known to affect the cell morphology, and perform a comparative statistical analysis between the linear and SRV metrics. Our study indicates superior performance of the SRV at capturing the cell shape heterogeneity, with a better separation between different cell groups when comparing their distance to their mean shape, as well as a better low dimensional representation when comparing stress statistics. Therefore, our study suggests the use of a Riemannian metric, such as the SRV as a potential tool to enhance morphological discrimination for large datasets of cancer cell images.",

abstract = {Cell movement—for example, during embryogenesis or tumor metastasis—is a complex dynamical process resulting from an intricate interplay of multiple components of the cellular migration machinery. At first sight, the paths of migrating cells resemble those of thermally driven Brownian particles. However, cell migration is an active biological process putting a characterization in terms of normal Brownian motion into question. By analyzing the trajectories of wild-type and mutated epithelial (transformed Madin–Darby canine kidney) cells, we show experimentally that anomalous dynamics characterizes cell migration. A superdiffusive increase of the mean squared displacement, non-Gaussian spatial probability distributions, and power-law decays of the velocity autocorrelations is the basis for this interpretation. Almost all results can be explained with a fractional Klein–Kramers equation allowing the quantitative classification of cell migration by a few parameters. Thereby, it discloses the influence and relative importance of individual components of the cellular migration apparatus to the behavior of the cell as a whole.}}

    abstract = {The mean square displacement (MSD) is an important statistical measure on a stochastic process or a trajectory. In this paper we find an approximation to the mean square displacement for a model of cell motion. The model is a discrete-time jump process which approximates a force-based model for cell motion. In cell motion, the mean square displacement not only gives a measure of overall drift, but it is also an indicator of mode of transport. The key to finding the approximation is to find the mean square displacement for a subset of the state space and use it as an approximation for the entire state space. We give some intuition as to why this is an unexpectedly good approximation. A lower bound and upper bound for the mean square displacement are also given. We show that, although the upper bound is far from the computed mean square displacement, in rare cases the large displacements are approached.},

abstract = {Molecular interactions are often transient and might change within the window of observation, leading to changes in molecule movement. Therefore, accurate motion analysis often requires transient motion classification. Here we present an accurate and computationally efficient transient mobility analysis framework, termed “divide-and-conquer moment scaling spectrum” (DC-MSS). DC-MSS works in a multistep fashion: 1) it utilizes a local movement descriptor throughout a track to divide it into initial segments of putatively different motion classes; 2) it classifies these segments via moment scaling spectrum (MSS) analysis of molecule displacements; and 3) it uses the MSS analysis results to refine the track segmentation. This strategy uncouples the initial identification of motion switches from motion classification, allowing DC-MSS to circumvent the sensitivity-accuracy tradeoff of classic rolling window approaches for transient motion analysis, while at the same time harnessing the classification power of MSS analysis. Testing of DC-MSS demonstrates that it detects switches among free diffusion, confined diffusion, directed diffusion, and immobility with great sensitivity. To illustrate the utility of DC-MSS, we have applied it to single-particle tracks of the transmembrane protein CD44 on the surface of macrophages, revealing actin cortex-dependent transient mobility changes.}

	abstract = {Signal transduction and cell function are governed by the spatiotemporal organization of membrane-associated molecules. Despite significant advances in visualizing molecular distributions by 3D light microscopy, cell biologists still have limited quantitative understanding of the processes implicated in the regulation of molecular signals at the whole cell scale. In particular, complex and transient cell surface morphologies challenge the complete sampling of cell geometry, membrane-associated molecular concentration and activity and the computing of meaningful parameters such as the cofluctuation between morphology and signals. Here, we introduce u-Unwrap3D, a framework to remap arbitrarily complex 3D cell surfaces and membrane-associated signals into equivalent lower dimensional representations. The mappings are bidirectional, allowing the application of image processing operations in the data representation best suited for the task and to subsequently present the results in any of the other representations, including the original 3D cell surface. Leveraging this surface-guided computing paradigm, we track segmented surface motifs in 2D to quantify the recruitment of Septin polymers by blebbing events; we quantify actin enrichment in peripheral ruffles; and we measure the speed of ruffle movement along topographically complex cell surfaces. Thus, u-Unwrap3D provides access to spatiotemporal analyses of cell biological parameters on unconstrained 3D surface geometries and signals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
