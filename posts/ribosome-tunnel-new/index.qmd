## Summary and Background

We present a protocol to extract the surface of a biomolecular cavity for shape analysis and molecular simulations.

We apply and illustrate the protocol on the ribosome structure, which contains a subcompartment known as the ribosome exit tunnel. More details on the tunnel features and biological importance can be found in our previous works [@dao2018impact; @dao2019differences]. The protocol was also design to refine the output obtained from MOLE software [@sehnal2013mole]
