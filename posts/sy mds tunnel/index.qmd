## Summary and Background

The ribosome exit tunnel is a sub-compartment of the ribosome whose geometry varies significantly across species, potentially affecting the translational dynamics and co-translational folding of nascent polypeptide [@dao2019differences].

As the recent advances in imaging technologies result in a surge of high-resolution ribosome structures, we are now able to study the tunnel geometric heterogeneity comprehensively across three domains of life: bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.

Here, we present some methods for large-scale analysis and comparison of tunnel structures.


## Tunnel Shape 


The ribosome exit tunnel spans from the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC), where amino acids are polymerized onto the growing nascent chain, to the surface of the ribosome.

Typically, it measures 80-100 Å in length and 10-20 Å in diameter. While the eukaryotic tunnels are, on average, shorter and substantially narrower than prokaryote ones [@dao2019differences]. 

In all domains of life, the tunnel features a universally conserved narrow region downstream of the PTC, so-called constriction site. However, the eukaryotic exit tunnel exhibit an additional (second) constriction site due to the modified structure of the surrounding ribosomal proteins.

## Ribosome Dataset

Cryo-EM reconstructions and X-ray crystallography structures of ribosomes were retrived from the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org) including 762 structures across 34 species domain. 

The exit tunnels were extracted from the ribosomes using our developed tunnel-searching pipeline based on the MOLE cavity extraction algorithm developed by Sehnal et al. [@sehnal2013mole].

## Pairwise Distance

To simplify the geomertic comparisons, we first reduced the tunnel structure into a coordinate set that describes both the centerline trajectory and the tunnel radius at each centerline position,

We then applied the pairwise distance metrics developed by Dao Duc et al. [@dao2019differences] to compute the geometric similarity between tunnels. More details can be found in the previous work [@dao2019differences].

## MDS

The Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) method developed by Li et al. [@li2023orthogonal] was applied on the pairwise distance matrix to visualize the geometric similarity of tunnels. Each data point represents a single tunnel structure, and the Euclidean distance between data points represents the similarity.
