    "# Abstract\n",
    "I have introduced some basic concepts of micro-circulation and the vascular networks and how they get created (angiogenesis) in health and disease. Then I discuss some angiogenesis models (Anderson-Chaplain as well as BARW) and use the tools of the geomstats to analyze the loopy structure in these networks. I explained the characteristics of the loopy structures in the networks in terms of the parameters of the model. Furthermore, I consider the time evolution of the graphs created by these networks and how the characterization of the loopy structures change through time in these networks."

    "Vascular network in animals is a complex network of vessels to carry the nutrients to and wastes out from the tissue. Main parts of the blood circulation system is determined during the embryo development (like the location and characterization of the main veins and arteries). However, the exact positioning and hierarchy of the capillary networks is not predetermined genetically, but is an adaptive process. A tissue under hypoxia (experiencing low oxygen) will initiate biochemical signals to recruit new vessels. One of the main signaling molecules is the tumor angiogenic factor (TAF) and as the name suggests it is highly expressed by tumor under oxygen stress (hypoxia). The TAF molecules will diffuse in the interstitial space. Upon interaction with pre-existing vessels, they will digest through the basal membrane of the pre-existing vessels and will activate the endothelial cells (that are lining the inner part lumen of all vessels in the body). The endothelial cells activated by TAF will turn into tip cells which will move up in the gradient of TAF, and they will make branches of vessels which will grow as the tip cells are moving. See figure below for details."

    "The Anderson-Chaplain model of angiogenesis is not the only formulation of this phenomena. A popular alternative formulation is using the notion of branching annihilating random walkers for the to explain the branching morphogenesis of vascular networks. A very detailed discussion on this formulation can be found in [@Hannezo2017,@Ucar2021]. This formulation has been also successful to models a vast variety of tip-driven morphogenesis in mammary-glands, prostate, kidney [@Hannezo2017], lymphatic system [@Ucar2023], neural branching [@Ucar2021], and etc.\n",

    "Vascular networks are not static structure, but rather the evolve in time in response to the changing metabolic demand of the underlying tissue, as well as the metabolic cost of the network itself, and the overall energy required to pump the fluid through the network (See  [@Pries2010,Secomb2012,@Pries2014,Ouarne2021] for more discussion). To put this in different words, the role of vascular networks is to deliver nutrients to the tissue and remove the wastes. To do this, it needs to have a space filling configuration with lots of branches. However, due to the Poiseuille law for the flow of fluids in a tube, the power needed to pump the fluid through the tube scales with $r^{-4}$ where $r$ is the radius of the tube. I.e. smaller vessel segments needs a huge power to pump the blood through them. Thus have a massively branched structure is not an optimal solution. On the other hand, the vascular network consists of cells which requires maintenance as well. Thus the optimized vascular network should have a low volume as well. Because of these dynamics in action, in the angiogenesis process first a mesh of new blood vessels form which later evolve to a more ordered and hierarchical structure in a self-organization process."

We define the pressure $\\mathbf{P}$ on the nodes, the flow $ \\mathbf{Q} $ on the edges, and let $C_{i,j}, L_{i,j}$ denote the conductivity of an edge, and $L_{i,j}$ denote the length of the same edge.
