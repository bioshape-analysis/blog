For instance we have convolving the image with 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity matrices to extract the graph structres present in the images. In the new approch, instead, we managed to record the structre of the network in a NetworkX datastructre. This is not easy task to perform without smart useage of the object oriented programming structure for the code. We organized our code into following classes"

Then we can use some of the built-in functions of this library to get the loops (cycles) of the network. However, since the generated networks are large, finding all of the loops (of all scales) is computationally very costly. Instead, we first found a minimal set of cycles in the graph that forms a basis for the cycles space. I.e. we found the loops that can be combined (by symmetric difference) to generate new loops. The following figure shows the basis loops highlighted on the graph."

    "The mechanism that generated the vascular networks is an stochastic process (Branching process + Simple Radnom Walk process + local interactions (annihilation)). So we need to use statistical notions to make some observations. In the figure below, the histogram of the cycle length is plotted. The interesting observation is the fact that the number of cycles is exponentially distributed (with respect to the Cycle length). The slope of this line (on log-log plot) can reveal some very important facts about the universality class that our model belongs to. Not only this is very interesting and important from theoretical point of view, but also it can have very useful practical applications. For instance, in comparing the simulated network with real vascualr networks, this slope can be one of the components of comparison."

Then given the vector $P$ that contains the pressures on the vertices, then the pressure difference on the edges will be given by $\\Delta P$, where $\\Delta$ is the transpose of the incidence matrix. This comes in handy when we want to calculate the flow of the edges which will be given by\n",
    "$$ \\bf{Q} = \\bf{C} L^{-1} \\bf{\\Delta} \\bf{P}, \\tag{2} $$\n",
    "where $ C $ is a diagonal matrix of the conductance of the edges, $L$ is the diagonal matrix of the ``length'' of each edge, $\\Delta$ is the transpose of the incidence matrix, and $P$ is the pressure on the nodes. $Q$ is the flow of the edges. In this particular example we are assuming that the relation between flow and the pressure difference is $Q_e = C_e (p_i - p_j)/L$. But we can have many other choices.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Knowing the sources and sinks on the nodes, the pressure can be determined by the Kirchhoff law\n",
    "\t$$ \\mathcal{L} \\bf{P} = \\bf{q}, $$\n",
    "where the vector $ q $ is the sources and the sinks values for each node. This is the same as solving the \\textbf{Poisson equation}. This can also be written in terms of the flow, i.e.\n",
    "\t$$ \\Delta^T \\bf{Q} = \\bf{q}. $$\n",
    "\tBy $ (2) $ we can write\n",
    "\t$$ (\\bf{\\Delta}^T \\bf{C}\\bf{L}^{-1}\\Delta) \\bf{P} = \\bf{q}. $$\n",
    "\tSince $ \\Delta = M^T $, the expression inside the parentheses is clearly Equation (1).\n",

    "Similar to the Poisson equation on the graph which is equivalent Kirchhoff's law, we can solve other types of heat and wave equations on the graph as well. The Laplacian matrix play a key role.\n",
