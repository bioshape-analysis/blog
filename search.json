This non-pathogenic species is otften used a biological model to study the pathogenic Mycobacteria such as M.tuberculosis (responsible for the tubercuosis) or M.abscessus, with which it shares the same cell wall structure(Tyagi and Sharma 2002) . In particular M.smegmatis has a fast growth (3-4 hours doubling time compared to 24h for M. tuberculosis), allowing for faster experimental protocols.\nHere are some know properties of M.smegmatis bacteria :\n\nThey present variation of cell diameter along their longitudinal axis (Eskandarian et al. 2017). The cell diameter is represented as a height profile along the cell centerline. We respectively name peaks and troughs the local maxima and minima of this proile.\n\n\n\n\n3D image of M.smegmatis. The orange line represents the height profile.\n\n\n\nThey grow following a biphasic and asymetrical polar dynamics(Hannebelle et al. 2020). The cells elongate from the poles, where material is added. After division, the pre-existing pole (OP) elongate at a high rate, whereas the newly created pole (NP) has first a slow growth, and then switches to a fast growth, after the New End Take Off (NETO).\n\n\n\n\nGrowth dynamics."

    "text": "3 Features\n\nData processing of eye tracking recordings\n\nTo run a statistical study on the data recorded, we carried out in two stages data processing. First using Tobio Pro Lab, then the EMADAT package. Following the experiments, the files are processed using Tobii Pro Lab software. We delimited the AOI for each page, manually pointed the gazes points for the 22 participants on the 12 selected pages. Then exported the data for each participant in a tsv format.\nThen EMDAT was used to generate the datasets. Indeed, to extract the gaze features we used EMDAT python 2.7. EMDAT stands for Eye Movement Data Analysis Toolkit, it is an open-source toolkit developed by our group. EMDAT receives three types of input folder: a folder containing the recordings from Tobii in a tsv format, a Segment folder containing the timestamp for the start and end of page reading for each participant, and an AOI folder containing the coordinates and the time spent per participant of each AOI per page. We have also automated the writing of the Segments and AOIs folders. Then we run the EMDAT script for each page. EMDAT also validates the quality of the recordings per page, here the parameter has been set to VALIDITY_METHOD = 1 (see documentation). In particular, we found that the quality of the data did not diminish over the course of the recordings.\n\nEye tracking features\n\nUpon following the data processing protocol, we extracted the following features:\n\nnumber of fixation (quantitative feature): The number of fixations denoted by is defined as the total number of fixations recorded over the total duration spent on a page by a participant.\nmean fixation duration (duration feature): The mean fixation duration denoted by is defined as as the average fixation duration during page reading.\nstandard deviation of the relative path angle (spatial feature): The standard deviation of the relative path angle denoted by is defined as as the average fixation duration during page reading.the standard deviation of the relative angle between two successive saccades. This component enables us to capture the consistency of a participant’s gaze pattern. The greater the standard deviation, the more likely the participant is to look across the different areas of a page."

To quantify these differences, we used a t-test to compare the means of the distributions, and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the distributions. Concerning the total number of fixations per page, the two populations seem to have the same characteristics (p-value&gt;0.1 and Cohen’s d=0.2) and to be from the same distribution (two sided K-s test p-value&gt;0.1). However, on the other two criteria, the autistic adolescents had a shorter mean fixation time and a lower standard deviation (p-value&lt;0.05, Cohen’s d &gt; 0.5), and their associated distribution was lower than that of the control population (less K-S test p-value&gt;0.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-test\nK-S test\n\n\n\n\nNum fixations\nNo statistically significant differences in the mean number of fixation (small effect size, two-sided p-value &gt; 0.1)\nThe distributions of the number of fixations per page look similar across the two populations (KS two-sided p-value &gt; 0.1)\n\n\nMean fixation duration\nND seems to have a shorter mean duration fixation (Negative medium effect size, two-sided p-value &lt; 0.01)\nThe ND mean fixation duration distribution is smaller than the NT mean fixation duration distribution (KS less p-value &gt; 0.1)\n\n\nStandard deviation relative path angle\nND seems to have on average a smaller std (Negative medium effect size, two-sided p-value &lt; 0.01)\nThe ND std relative path angle distribution is smaller than the NT std relative path angle distribution (KS less p-value &gt; 0.1)"

The resulting histogram of roundness scores of all clusters will follow a bimodal distribution, with its two peaks correspond to spots and stripes, respectively.\n\nalpha_values = [.3, 0.4, 0.6, 1.]\n# Plot the flower shape and alpha shapes with varying alpha values\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(6,6))\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor i, alpha in enumerate(alpha_values):\n    plt.subplot(2,2,i+1)\n    # Compute alpha shape\n    alpha_shape = alphashape.alphashape(coords, alpha)\n    if alpha_shape.geom_type == 'MultiPolygon':\n        # Extract and print the area of each polygon\n        areas = [polygon.area for polygon in list(alpha_shape.geoms)]\n        perimeters = [polygon.length for polygon in list(alpha_shape.geoms)]\n        roundness = [4*np.pi*areas[i]/perimeters[i]**2 for i in range(len(list(alpha_shape.geoms))) ]\n    else:\n        areas = [ alpha_shape.area ]\n        perimeters = [alpha_shape.length]\n        roundness = [areas[0]*4*np.pi/perimeters[0]**2]\n    plt.hist(roundness,density=True, range=[0,1])\n    plt.xlim([0,1])\n    plt.title(f'Roundness with alpha={alpha}')\n    \n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"

    "text": "In the context of cryo-EM, many computationaly exhaustive methods rely on simpler representations of cryo-EM density maps to overcome their scalability challenges. There are many choices to the form of the simpler representation, such as vectors (Han et al. 2021) or mixture of gussians (Kawabata 2008). In this post we discuss a format which is probably the simplest and that is using a set of points (called point cloud).\nThis problem can be formulated in a much more general sense rather than cryo-EM. In this sense we are given a probability distribution over \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) and we want to generate a set of 3D points that represent this distribution. The naive approach to find such a point cloud is to just sample points from the distribution. Although this approach is guaranteed to find a good representation, it needs lots of points to cover the distribution evenly. Since methods used in this field can be computationally intensive with cubic or higher time complexity, generating a point cloud that covers the give distribution with a smaller point cloud could lead to a significant improvement in their runtime.\nIn this approach, we present two methods for generating a point cloud from a cryo-EM density map or a distribution in general. The first one is based on the Topological Representing Network (TRN) (Martinetz and Schulten 1994) and the second one combines the usage the Optimal Transport (OT) (Peyré, Cuturi, et al. 2019) theory and and some computational geometry object named Centroidal Vornoi Tessellation (CVT).\n\n\nFor the sake of simplicity in this post we assume we are given a primal distribution over \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). As an example we will work on multivariate gaussian distribution that it’s domain is limited to \\([0, 1]^2\\). The following code prepares and illustrates the pdf of the example distribution.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy as scp\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (20,20)\n\n\n\nmean = np.array([0,0])\ncov = np.array([[0.5, 0.25], [0.25, 0.5]])\ndistr = scp.stats.multivariate_normal(cov = cov, mean = mean, seed = 1)\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,8))\nim = ax.imshow([[distr.pdf([i/100,j/100]) for i in range(100,-100,-1)] for j in range(-100,100)], extent=[-1, 1, -1, 1])\ncbar = ax.figure.colorbar(im, ax=ax)\nplt.title(\"The pdf of our primal distribution\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of the methods that we are going to cover are iterative methods. For generating a point cloud of size \\(n\\), they begin by randomly sampling \\(n\\) points and refining it over iterations. To make the illustration interesting we used a uniform point cloud for initial samples. We use \\(n=200\\) in our examples.\n\ndef sampler(rvs):\n    while True:\n        sample = rvs(1)\n        if abs(sample[0]) &gt; 1 or abs(sample[1]) &gt; 1:\n            continue\n        return sample\n\n# The commented code will begin with initial samples drawn from the primal distribution instead of uniform\n\n# initial_samples = []\n# while len(initial_samples) &lt; 200:\n#     sample = sampler(distr.rvs)\n#     initial_samples.append(list(sample))\n# initial_samples = np.array(initial_samples)\ninitial_samples = np.random.uniform(-1,1,(200,2))\n\nl = list(zip(*initial_samples))\nx = list(l[0])\ny = list(l[1])\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,8))\nax.scatter(x, y)\nax.plot((-1,-1), (-1,1), 'k-')\nax.plot((-1,1), (-1,-1), 'k-')\nax.plot((1,1), (1,-1), 'k-')\nax.plot((-1,1), (1,1), 'k-')\nplt.ylim(-1.1,1.1)\nplt.xlim(-1.1,1.1)\nplt.show()"
